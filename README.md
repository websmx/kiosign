# kiosign
A new flexible way to create Kiosks and Digital Signage using Wordpress. Currently in Development

Uses Advanced Custom Fields (Pro license required) for scheduling, and Vue.js for logic and rendering. Uses commercially available sliders (like SmartSlider, Slider Revolution, and LayerSlider), page builders (like Elementor, Beaver Builder or DIVI), posts and custom html for content.  We hope to make this a flexible and powerful system for designers and developers to make kiosks and digital signage using Wordpress as a platform.
